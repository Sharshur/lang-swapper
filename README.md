# lang-swapper
A tool which quickly swaps mistyped text meant to be written in one language to the correct one.

For example, you want to type "Hello, how are you?" but your keyboard was accidentally on Hebrew, and you typed: "Hקךךםת ים' שרק טםו?"

The program simulates keyboard presses to automatically select, swap, and change your language to the correct one so you can continue your typing seamlessly.
